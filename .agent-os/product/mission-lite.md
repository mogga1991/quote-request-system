# Product Mission (Lite)

## Elevator Pitch
GovBid AI is an AI-powered government contracting platform targeting small to mid-size businesses (5-100 employees) entering federal contracting. We automate opportunity discovery, requirement analysis, and supplier matching with 6 AI API endpoints, reducing bid preparation time by 70-80%. Core features include SAM.gov integration, AI document parsing, intelligent quote aggregation, and ML-powered bid success prediction.

**Purpose:** Fast-load context for agents (Claude, Cursor) and tools limited by token/context window.
