**Project:** RLP Software Platform  
**Feature:** Quote Request System  
**Date:** 2025-09-18  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## Implementation Checklist

This checklist breaks down the Quote Request System implementation into 5 major phases, each building incrementally toward a complete solution. Each phase follows TDD principles with testing as the first step.

---

## 1. Database Foundation & Core Schema

**Goal:** Establish the database schema, migrations, and core data access layer for quote requests functionality.

- [ ] 1.1 Write comprehensive tests for database schema and relationships
- [ ] 1.2 Create Drizzle migration files for new tables (quote_requests, quote_request_suppliers, supplier_responses)
- [ ] 1.3 Update existing db/schema.ts with new table definitions and relationships
- [ ] 1.4 Run database migrations and verify schema integrity
- [ ] 1.5 Implement data access layer functions with proper error handling
- [ ] 1.6 Create seed data for development and testing environments
- [ ] 1.7 Add database indexes for query performance optimization
- [ ] 1.8 Verify all tests pass for database foundation scope

---

## 2. Core API Endpoints & Business Logic

**Goal:** Build the foundational API routes for CRUD operations on quote requests with proper validation and authentication.

- [ ] 2.1 Write/extend tests for all API endpoints and business logic validation
- [ ] 2.2 Implement quote request list API with filtering, sorting, and pagination (GET /api/quote-requests)
- [ ] 2.3 Create quote request creation API with validation schemas (POST /api/quote-requests)
- [ ] 2.4 Build quote request details API with nested supplier/response data (GET /api/quote-requests/[id])
- [ ] 2.5 Implement quote request update API with status transition validation (PUT /api/quote-requests/[id])
- [ ] 2.6 Add quote request deletion API with business rule constraints (DELETE /api/quote-requests/[id])
- [ ] 2.7 Integrate Better Auth authentication and role-based access control
- [ ] 2.8 Verify all tests pass for core API scope

---

## 3. AI Integration & Quote Generation

**Goal:** Integrate OpenAI for intelligent quote request generation from opportunity data with proper fallbacks.

- [ ] 3.1 Write/extend tests for AI generation service and error handling scenarios
- [ ] 3.2 Implement OpenAI service integration with structured output format
- [ ] 3.3 Create AI quote generation API endpoint (POST /api/quote-requests/[id]/generate-ai)
- [ ] 3.4 Build opportunity data extraction and context preparation logic
- [ ] 3.5 Add AI-powered requirement categorization and prioritization
- [ ] 3.6 Implement rate limiting and quota management for AI requests
- [ ] 3.7 Create fallback mechanisms for AI service failures
- [ ] 3.8 Verify all tests pass for AI integration scope

---

## 4. Supplier Management & Response System

**Goal:** Enable supplier invitation, response collection, and communication workflows with proper notification system.

- [ ] 4.1 Write/extend tests for supplier invitation and response workflows
- [ ] 4.2 Implement supplier invitation API with bulk selection (POST /api/quote-requests/[id]/suppliers)
- [ ] 4.3 Create supplier response submission API (POST /api/quote-requests/[id]/respond)
- [ ] 4.4 Build supplier response listing and management (GET /api/quote-requests/[id]/responses)
- [ ] 4.5 Add email notification system for supplier invitations and deadlines
- [ ] 4.6 Implement supplier authentication flow for quote response access
- [ ] 4.7 Create response status tracking and deadline management
- [ ] 4.8 Verify all tests pass for supplier management scope

---

## 5. UI Components & Export Functionality

**Goal:** Build the complete user interface and document export capabilities with professional styling and user experience.

- [ ] 5.1 Write/extend tests for React components and export functionality
- [ ] 5.2 Create quote request list page with DataTable, filtering, and sorting (/dashboard/quote-requests)
- [ ] 5.3 Build quote request creation form with multi-step wizard (/dashboard/quote-requests/create)
- [ ] 5.4 Implement quote request detail view with supplier response management (/dashboard/quote-requests/[id])
- [ ] 5.5 Add bulk operations interface for multiple quote request management
- [ ] 5.6 Integrate Cloudflare R2 for file storage and PDF export generation
- [ ] 5.7 Create comprehensive export functionality (PDF, CSV, Excel formats)
- [ ] 5.8 Verify all tests pass for complete Quote Request System implementation

---

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

Upon completion of all tasks, the system must satisfy these key requirements:

**User Experience:**
- [ ] Users can create quote requests from opportunity data within 3 clicks
- [ ] AI generates contextually relevant quote requests with proper specifications
- [ ] Suppliers receive structured forms and can submit responses easily
- [ ] Bulk quote requests can be sent to 10+ suppliers simultaneously

**Technical Requirements:**
- [ ] System exports quote data in CSV, PDF, and Excel formats
- [ ] Audit trail captures all activities with timestamps and user attribution
- [ ] Quote request status updates in real-time with automated notifications
- [ ] Integration displays quote status within opportunity records

**Performance & Security:**
- [ ] Database queries perform efficiently with proper indexing
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse of AI and export services
- [ ] Role-based access control protects sensitive quote data
- [ ] File uploads are validated and stored securely

---

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

**Before Starting:**
- Existing opportunities and suppliers tables must be populated
- Better Auth authentication system must be functional
- OpenAI API key and Cloudflare R2 credentials must be configured
- Development environment with proper test database setup

**External Services:**
- OpenAI API (GPT-4 Turbo) for AI generation
- Cloudflare R2 for file storage and exports
- Email service for supplier notifications
- Better Auth for authentication and authorization

---

**Implementation Notes:**
- Each major task should be deployable independently
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing opportunity system
- Follow established code style and testing patterns
- Prioritize security and data validation throughout implementation
